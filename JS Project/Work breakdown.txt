*** This is a CHALLENGE you are setting yourself. You need to make it through this with GRIT and DETERMINATION. ***

There are the following components on the page:

With left and right margins for the entire page content. 
Top Header:
	VP Logo | Search box | Buttons
Top Nav:
	11 buttons [FLEX]
Main Content
	Split into two columns
	Left:
		Image
		Image scroller underneath
	Right:
		Title
		Reviews component
		Text detail
		Designer:
			Buttons: 
				events for onClick, onHover, onChange, event listeners.
				Question: How would I build if-then logic for each of the button clicks? For e.g. clicking on "Horizontal" removes an option below it.
				CSS Styling for click, hover, selected.		
Footer
	4 columns with lists of links in them
	
I have to learn:
	CSS:
		Link external CSS				DONE
		CSS Grid?						DONE
			Padding is WITHIN the box.	
		Flex							DONE
		Float							DONE
			Float doesn't work so well because it causes child elements not to size equally relative to each other.

			(CSS Grid excellent tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o&t=784s)
		Positioning elements on pages.
	
	JS:
		onClick
		onHover
		onChange
		Event Listeners
